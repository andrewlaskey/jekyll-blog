[Water â€“ Less Than You Think](http://www.lessthanyouthink.me/) was a side project, I designed and developed at Idiom. Using [jmpress.js](http://jmpressjs.github.io/jmpress.js/#/home) and CSS3 animations, the site is a guided presentation, visualizing the limited water resources we all share on Earth, and ends with a interactive challenge to get users to use less.

[Lessthanyouthink.me](http://www.lessthanyouthink.me/) was awarded [Honorable Mention from Awwwards](http://www.awwwards.com/best-websites/less-than-you-think).
