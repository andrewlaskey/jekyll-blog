Elect Different was a project I completed in 2011, after being generally fed up with the state of Congress and the Senate, and trying to come up with some kind of solution. The idea was to create a centralized platform for third party candidates to advertise their campaigns, and for voters to easily find these alternative candidates for their state or district. After completing the site, I learned more about some of the fundamental problems of first pass the post elections, and why, especially in larger elections third party candidates will be at a disadvantage or worse contribute to a spoiler effect.

The site is a complete CRUD website built from scratch in PHP with a MySQL database. The forms are disabled and I no longer maintain it, but it was a good learning experience.
