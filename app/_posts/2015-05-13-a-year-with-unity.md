excerpt: "A look at the different experiments and half games I made last year while learning Unity3d."

In 2014 I took a break from working on different web projects like [CampChaser](http://andrewlaskey.com/work/2014/03/01/campchaser.html) and [Safari Feed](http://andrewlaskey.com/work/2015/04/02/safari-feed.html) in my free time to learn game development using Unity.  While web development is fun,  and I've even made a couple [web](http://andrewlaskey.com/work/2014/03/01/banana-drop.html) [games](http://andrewlaskey.com/work/2014/03/01/mathematap.html), programming a "real" game has always been on the back of my mind. Fortunately the past few years have been really good for hobbyist game developers like myself with many (free) frameworks allowing a sole developer to do it all without having to write an engine from scratch. All the tools were sitting there for me to get use. If I wanted to make a game, nothing was stopping me.

So how did it go?

Unity has been a great tool to work with. It is well documented and the community hugely helpful and supportive. As a testament to these resources, in my first week with Unity while I was on vacation, I managed to put together a fun proof-of-concept space shooter. My personal take on the Asteroid shooter had a mini solar system with orbiting planetoids and simulated planetary gravity. As first experiment with Unity I'm still proud of it, and I'd like to build it out a little more even if it ends up being a one-level demo.

My goal for the year was to make a complete, published game. While each of these demos and weird experiments never turned into a full game I learned a lot from C#, to 2d sprite animation, procedural generation, relearning 3d modeling in blender and SketchUp, to game design and how to scope a project while keeping your ambitions in check. And even though I'm busy working on my [current](https://twitter.com/andrewlaskey/status/596754834826481664) [game](https://twitter.com/andrewlaskey/status/594620606659735552) project that will be released, there are a few with a germ of something worth cultivating later.
