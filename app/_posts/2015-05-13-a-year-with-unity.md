excerpt: "A look at the different experiments and half games I made last year while learning Unity3d."

In 2014 I took a break from working on web projects in my free time to experimenting with Unity.

* want to make games

* if you want to make something, make it. the tools are there.

* learning C#

* florida

* space shooter

* planets and gravity

* keep working on it

While on vacation in Florida, I put together this basic space shooter as my first Unity project. The player pilots a little craft around a mini solar system, using the gravity of planets, moons, and the star to get around. As first experiment with Unity I'm still proud of it, and I'd like to build it out a little more even if it ends up being a one-level demo.

#####3d Movement Demo

The goal of this demo was have an easy movement and camera control scheme that was touch screen or mouse-only compatible. I was planning to grow it into a 3d underwater exploration game, but decided that was unrealistic as a second project.

#####Surf Game
