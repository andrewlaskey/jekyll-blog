From 2009 to 2011 I worked at Olive Branch Green Building Supply where I helped sell healthy and environmentally friendly products. I helped design store signage, write monthly newsletters, and eventually update the company website. I rebuilt the site, from their original iWeb built site, with a Wordpress template. Unfortunately in 2013, Olive Branch Green Building Supply closed its doors
