####A few news sites open things up with their redesigns



Most news websites are terrible for actually reading the news. This isn’t a new problem, and its been discussed a lot before, but very few of these sites feel the need to do anything about it.

What are the main issues?

* **Crowded content** — Too many ads, big image banners above the actual article text, sidebars cluttered related articles or ads
* **Slow to load** — Social sharing widgets and way too much random javascript, slowing load times for a document that shouldn’t be more than text and a few images.

Thankfully more and more sites seem to be doing a little bit to make things better, cleaning the clutter and focusing on what reader really wants: to read an article. These are a few popular news site redesigns that I’ve noticed recently:

*Above the fold, ads take up a bit too much space, but though images are large, its much less densely packed.*

*Look at all that wide open space!*

*Their tablet app-like redesign is easy to digest on desktop browsers as well.*

*Very readable. The progress bar is also a cool touch.*

This is a very small sampling, but I hope it is representative of a growing trend. Removing unnecessary sidebars, [making social sharing buttons less intrusive](http://cferdinandi.github.io/social-sharing), [setting a good font size and line length](http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html), and opening up the whole page with more padding, margins, and whitespace all help in making content easier to read.

Also I haven’t done any testing, but all of these sites, if just perceptually, appear to load faster as well. Desktops and mobile phones may be getting faster every day, but that doesn’t mean [website file sizes should be getting bigger in turn](http://gigaom.com/2012/05/23/the-growing-epidemic-of-page-bloat/).

The web is and has been for a long time turning into a platform for games, videos, interactive art, and much more, but that doesn’t mean sites focused on articles, essays, or blogs should be any more elaborate than they need to be. Clean design and good typography is all that’s needed to make text engaging.

What are some other news sites that are redesigning themselves with readability in mind?
